# Description:

This is the collection of best known design patterns and sample codes to show how to implement them in java.

# Contents:

# Creational patterns
-	**Abstract Factory**:
Creates an instance of several families of classes
-	**Builder**:
Separates object construction from its representation
-	**Factory Method**:
Creates an instance of several derived classes
-	**Object Pool**:
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
-	**Prototype**:
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
-	**Singleton**:
A class of which only a single instance can exist


# Structural patterns
-	**Adapter**:
Match interfaces of different classes
-	**Bridge**:
Separates an object's interface from its implementation
-	**Composite**:
A tree structure of simple and composite objects
-	**Decorator**:
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
-	**Facade**:
A single class that represents an entire subsystem
-	**Flyweight**:
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
-	**Private Class Data**:
Restricts accessor/mutator access
-	**Proxy**:
An object representing another object


# Behavioral patterns
-	**Chain of responsibility**:
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
-	**Command**:
Encapsulate a command request as an object
-	**Interpreter**:
A way to include language elements in a program
-	**Iterator**:
Sequentially access the elements of a collection
-	**Mediator**:
Defines simplified communication between classes
-	**Memento**:
Capture and restore an object's internal state
-   **Null Object**:
Designed to act as a default value of an object
-	**Observer**:
A way of notifying change to a number of classes
-   **State**:
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
-	**Strategy**:
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
-	**Template method**:
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
-	**Visitor**:
Defines a new operation to a class without change
